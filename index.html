<body id="page1">
    <div class="intro-text">
        <p>This project is inspired by <a href="https://depue.design">Will DePue</a>. I deeply resonated with the idea of Ephemeral Notes, so I created my own version.</p>

        <p>Free writing is something I have been doing for a long time. It has helped me gain clarity over my thoughts, in turn, developing my thinking process.
            We think we know something very well until we write about it. Brain is a funny thing.
             Mostly, we are living in our heads. 
             When we are forced to Realize our ideas either by talking or writing about them,
              we find out reality is vividly different than what we thought.

        <p>Writing down your ideas exposes you. When you read what you were thinking, it often feels shitty.
            
        Writing is the greatest superpower a human can have. And doing it efficiently can reap you unimaginable yields.</p>
            
        <p> This is a disappearing notepad for thinkers. All words take 120 seconds
            to entirely disappear. If you want to keep something, feel free to write it
            again - the same way you would call a thought back from memory. There is no option for text-formatting because complexity is rarely a proxy for intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>Wishing you insightful reflections...</p>
