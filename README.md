# Transient Notes

This project is inspired by [Will DePue.](https://depue.design) I deeply resonated with the idea of Ephemeral Notes, so I created my own version.

Transient Notes is a disappearing notepad for thinkers. All words take 120 seconds to entirely disappear. If you want to keep something, feel free to write it again - the same way you would call a thought back from memory. There is no option for text formatting because complexity is rarely a proxy for intelligence.

You can try it [here.](https://jyntjkr.github.io/transient-notes/)
